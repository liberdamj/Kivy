# Kivy

Kivy is an open source python library for application development. Their website is linked [here](https://kivy.org/#home).

This repository holds Kivy projects I have worked on in order to expand my knowledge of Kivy as well as the Kv language.

Documentation for Kivy can be found [here](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/).
